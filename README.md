Yes, I tried to make a new application named stockholm foodbank where I used different types of data from the MongoDB server for the very first time. It's really a great experience. Finally I shown the product or food detail on UI.
I made a Header component where I shown navigation bars and in Home component, I shown the different food names, image and price that all came from my database. 
I used imagebb to store product photos and posted to batabase from there. 
I used private route because of customers security. I also used private route for Administration for more secure the database but need to study more on that. From my point of view customers and admin anyone can login and add data into database that is not perfect.
I tried to show the specific product or food on checkout ui page but tried to catch that by id but can not show that except id. I spent a lot of hours to fix it but not done yet. However, need to pass more time on that to get better result in near future.
